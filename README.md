# QuantPOT
This repo presents the source code used in "Gradient estimation for ultra low precision POT and additive POT quantization"
## Custom gradient estimation for low bit width quantization
The code for custom gradient estimation and quantization error is inspired by [APoT_Quantization](https://github.com/yhhhli/APoT_Quantization). 
## Integer deployable implementation
The code for the integer deployable implementaiton is inspired by NEMO tool, a library for minimization of Deep Neural Networks developed in PyTorch for PULP-based microcontrollers
[NEMO (NEural Minimizer for pytOrch)]([https://github.com/yhhhli/APoT_Quantization](https://github.com/pulp-platform/nemo).
